          <p>I am a Graduate Student in the Dept. of Computer Science, at SUNY Buffalo and I live in Buffalo, NY.</p>
          My primary interests are Operating Systems and Distributed Sytems. I am a Technology and Computers
          enthusiast in general, and GNU/Linux and Open Source enthusiast in particular.
          I was born and brought up in India, in the town of Mysore, near Bangalore.
          I enjoy coding, more so if it is C, and even more so if the editor is Vi!
          Other than code, I love exploring nature and driking Beer. And hey, I can play some cool songs on my guitar too.
          I am always keen to work on interesting projects. If you want to work with me or hire me or just say hi, send me an email.
          <p>You can also find me on LinkedIn and Github.</p>

            Hydra is an ambitious project to develop a distributed, fault tolerant block device aimed to replace RAID in large clusters.
            It uses Reed Soloman erasure coding for data resiliency and providives a unique feature of having a variable degree of fault tolerance at a
            granuliaity of a single block, chosen by the user.
